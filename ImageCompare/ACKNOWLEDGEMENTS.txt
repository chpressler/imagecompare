swing-bug-demo contains the filter library from jhlabs 
(http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/index.html) in its entirity. For ease of
distribution the library is distributed in source form so that the code
can easily be built into a single file. However, unless specifically noted
the source has not been changed. 

Many thanks to jhlabs for producing this excellent set of ImageFilters.

swing-bug depends on the source code for JBookPanel originally posted under the
apache 2 license at http://jroller.com/page/pieterjan?entry=jbookpanel_and_the_page_turn
